    "prompt": "<image>\nWho is more likely to use these tools a leather crafter or a paper crafter?",
    "chosen": "A leather crafter is more likely to use these tools. The image shows various crafting tools, including scissors and a hole punch, which are commonly used in leatherworking projects. Leather is a material that requires cutting, shaping, and precise hole-punching techniques to create desired designs or patterns. In contrast, paper crafters typically use different types of tools, such as adhesives, decorative papers, or specialized cutting machines like the Silhouette Cameo, for their projects.",
